/**
 * Base class for JSR166 Junit TCK tests. Defines some constants, utility methods and classes, as
 * well as a simple framework for helping to make sure that assertions failing in generated threads
 * cause the associated test that generated them to itself fail (which JUnit does not otherwise
 * arrange). The rules for creating such tests are:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>All assertions in code running in generated threads must use the forms {@link
 *       #threadUnexpectedException} or {@link #threadRecordFailure} (which is called by {@link
 *       CheckedRunnable} and {@link CheckedCallable}).
 *   <li>If you override {@link #tearDown}, make sure to invoke {@code super.tearDown} within it.
 *       This method is used to clear and check for thread assertion failures.
 *   <li>All threads generated must be joined inside each test case method (or {@code fail} to do
 *       so) before returning from the method. The {@code joinPool} method can be used to do this
 *       when using Executors.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>Other notes</b>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Usually, there is one testcase method per JSR166 method covering "normal" operation, and
 *       then as many exception-testing methods as there are exceptions the method can throw.
 *       Sometimes there are multiple tests per JSR166 method when the different "normal" behaviors
 *       differ significantly. And sometimes testcases cover multiple methods when they cannot be
 *       tested in isolation.
 *   <li>The documentation style for testcases is to provide as javadoc a simple sentence or two
 *       describing the property that the testcase method purports to test. The javadocs do not say
 *       anything about how the property is tested. To find out, read the code.
 *   <li>These tests are "conformance tests", and do not attempt to test throughput, latency,
 *       scalability or other performance factors (see the separate "jtreg" tests for a set intended
 *       to check these for the most central aspects of functionality.) So, most tests use the
 *       smallest sensible numbers of threads, collection sizes, etc needed to check basic
 *       conformance.
 *   <li>The test classes currently do not declare inclusion in any particular package to simplify
 *       things for people integrating them in TCK test suites.
 * </ul>
